            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a bioinformatician with experience in genomic data analysis, molecular diagnostics, and multi-omics integration. I am passionate about applying machine learning and AI to biological data, particularly in infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. I have worked across academia and industry, from rare disease and cancer genomics at Genomics England to malaria population genomics at MRC Unit The Gambia (LSHTM). My work bridges computational pipelines and biological insight, with a strong focus on reproducibility and collaborative problem-solving.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <p class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/halimasalam/AdaptiveSeqVCall" target="_blank">Adaptive Sampling Variant Calling in Cancer Panels</a></p>
                <p>Developed a Nextflow pipeline to compare Oxford Nanopore adaptive sampling with whole-genome sequencing for variant detection in 678 COSMIC cancer panel genes. Achieved high concordance in SNV and SV detection, with added methylation profiling capabilities. Clinically confirmed a complex heterozygous deletion in the EYS gene.</p>
