      <!-- Adaptive Sampling -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Adaptive Sampling Variant Calling</h3>
        <p><em>Comparing Nanopore Adaptive Sampling to Whole Genome Sequencing for cancer gene variant detection</em></p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Context:</strong> Whole genome sequencing provides comprehensive variant detection but is costly and often sequences regions that can be irrelevant to a given clinical question. Adaptive sampling offers a way to selectively enrich target genes in real time, which potentially reduce costs and increase efficiency.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">My Role:</strong> I developed a Nextflow-based variant calling pipeline to analyze Nanopore adaptive sampling data targeting 678 COSMIC cancer panel genes, comparing results with matched whole genome sequencing data. Analyses included single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), structural variants (SVs), CpG methylation, and haplotype phasing.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Outcome:</strong> Adaptive sampling matched WGS performance for SNVs and SVs, while providing additional methylation and haplotype information. The pipeline identified a complex heterozygous deletion in <em>EYS</em> that was later clinically confirmed.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Impact:</strong> Demonstrated that adaptive sampling can deliver accurate, clinically relevant results at reduced cost and sequencing time, with potential for targeted diagnostics in oncology.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Tech Stack:</strong> Oxford Nanopore, Nextflow, GATK, Clair3, Sniffles, modbam2bed, Python, R.</p>

        <h3>Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance</h3>
        <p><em>Validating Oxford Nanopore sequencing for variant detection in wastewater as part of UK SARS-CoV-2 surveillance</em></p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Context:</strong> Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) provides a scalable, non-invasive way to monitor community-level pathogen spread, and can detect emerging variants before they are observed in clinical testing. However, Illumina sequencing which is the current standard for variant detection is costly and resource-intensive for routine monitoring. This project assessed whether Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing could provide a reliable, lower-cost alternative for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">My Role:</strong> As a bioinformatician at the University of Nottingham, I co-led the bioinformatics analysis within a UK Health Security Agency–funded collaboration involving the Universities of Exeter and Liverpool. I processed both synthetic wastewater samples (spiked with Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants) and real environmental samples from multiple UK locations. Adapted the EasySeq™ RC-PCR Illumina protocol for ONT sequencing and integrated it with the ARTIC field bioinformatics pipeline. For Illumina, executed FASTQ merging, adapter trimming, alignment, sorting, primer trimming, variant calling, and lineage deconvolution, while for Nanopore data, followed ARTIC-compatible workflows. Developed custom Python and R scripts for processing, visualization, and statistical analysis.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Outcome:</strong> ONT sequencing delivered variant detection performance comparable to Illumina, even in low-viral-load wastewater samples, while reducing turnaround time and infrastructure requirements. The approach successfully resolved complex mixed samples and co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages within a single wastewater sample.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Impact:</strong> Demonstrated that portable ONT sequencing is a viable option for decentralized, field-based genomic surveillance — enabling rapid response to emerging pathogens, especially in resource-limited or remote settings.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Tech Stack:</strong> Oxford Nanopore, Illumina, pigz, fastp, bwa-mem, Samtools, ivar, VarScan, Freyja, Python, R.</p>

      <!-- Plasmodium -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Plasmodium Population Genomics</h3>
        <p><em>Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of malaria parasites to investigate population structure, drug resistance, and evolutionary dynamics</em></p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Context:</strong> Understanding the genetic diversity and adaptation of <em>Plasmodium</em> species is essential for malaria control and elimination. Genomic approaches reveal how drug resistance, host immunity, and environmental variation shape parasite populations, guiding more effective interventions, especially for less-studied species such as <em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. malariae</em>.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">My Role:</strong> At the MRC Unit The Gambia (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine), I analyze whole-genome and transcriptomic datasets from <em>P. falciparum</em>, <em>P. malariae</em>, and <em>P. vivax</em> collected across Africa and Southeast Asia. My work includes population structure analyses (PCA, ADMIXTURE), within-host diversity metrics (F<sub>ws</sub>), identity-by-descent (IBD) detection, selective sweep detection, and drug-resistance marker profiling (crt, mdr1, dhfr, dhps, kelch13). I also conduct evolutionary analysis of malaria vaccine candidate antigens (PfAMA1, PfCelTOS), assessing population structure, interconnectivity, genetic differentiation, selection pressures, and predicting B-cell epitopes. Additionally, I integrate metagenomic data to study gut microbiome composition in malaria cases and support continent-wide analyses of pfhrp2/pfhrp3 gene deletions.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Outcome:</strong> Generated high-resolution population structure maps of <em>Plasmodium</em> species, identified signals of positive selection at drug-resistance loci, and assessed genetic diversity and selection in pfhrp2/3 across African isolates. Vaccine antigen analyses revealed geographic patterns in diversity, population connectivity, and immune epitope distribution, informing vaccine design strategies. Transcriptomic analyses identified downregulation of rifin gene families in asymptomatic <em>P. falciparum</em> infections, suggesting a role in immune evasion. Integrated microbiome-genome analyses also revealed microbial community shifts associated with malaria severity.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Impact:</strong> Contributed to genomic surveillance frameworks for malaria, supporting drug policy, diagnostic strategies, and vaccine candidate evaluation. I also contributed to manuscript preparation for multiple outputs from this project, all of which are in preparation for publication.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Tech Stack:</strong> Nextflow, Snakemake, GATK, BWA, ADMIXTURE, IQ-TREE, Epitope prediction tools, R, Python.</p>

      <!-- Multiome ML -->
      <div class="project-card">
        <h3>Multiome ML Integration</h3>
        p><em>Machine learning framework for integrative analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data to classify immune cell types and map Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk variants</em></p>         
        <p><strong class="project-label">Context:</strong> Single-cell multi-omics, such as paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, provide complementary views of cellular state transcriptome and chromatin accessibility, but integrating them effectively remains challenging. Linking this data with disease-associated genetic variants offers a way to uncover cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms in complex diseases like Alzheimer’s.</p>          
        <p><strong class="project-label">My Role:</strong> I designed and implemented a supervised machine learning pipeline to integrate transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility features from single-cell PBMC data. Built baseline multi-class logistic regression and an optimized XGBoost classifier to predict immune cell subtypes. I mapped Alzheimer’s disease GWAS SNPs to cell-type-specific ATAC peaks and genes, identifying potential regulatory elements linked to disease risk.</p>  
        <p><strong class="project-label">Outcome:</strong> The multimodal XGBoost classifier achieved ~92% accuracy in immune cell classification. Top predictive RNA features included <em>PAX5</em>, <em>BANK1</em>, <em>MS4A1</em> (B cells); <em>LYZ</em>, <em>VCAN</em>, <em>CDKN1C</em> (monocytes); and <em>GNLY</em>, <em>GZMB</em>, <em>ZEB2</em> (cytotoxic T/NK cells). Top ATAC features included <em>KLRG1</em>, <em>IL2RB</em> (T/NK function), <em>HCK</em>, <em>ARHGAP24</em> (monocyte-related), and <em>LINC02446</em> (a potential regulatory ncRNA). Integration with Alzheimer’s GWAS identified 14 overlapping genes including <em>BANK1</em>, <em>MEF2C</em>, <em>ANK3</em>, and <em>TCF7L2</em> with distinct immune cell-type enrichments, highlighting monocytes, dendritic cells, and B cells as potential mediators of disease risk.</p>
        <p><strong class="project-label">Impact:</strong> This project demonstrated the utility of combining single-cell multi-omics and ML to connect genetic risk with cell-type-specific regulatory programs, providing a framework adaptable to other complex diseases.</p>
